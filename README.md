Pig Latin Converter
=================
This project is a simple web application built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf that serves to convert text into Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a playful way of transforming English words and phrases, often used as a children's game and a language learning tool.

How it works
=================
The application allows users to input a text string and then performs the conversion ti Pig Latin. The conversion follows a few simple rules:

*Words that start with a vowel (A,E,I,O,U) simply have "AY" appended to the end of the word.

*Words that start with a consonant have all consonant letters up to the first vowel moved to the end of the word and "AY" is appended.
